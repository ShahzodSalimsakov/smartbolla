      <p>
        1. Any information transferred by the Parties to each other when using
        the resources of the Site (smartbolla.com) is confidential information.
        The site smartbolla.com does not control and is not responsible for
        third-party sites to which the User can click on the links available on
        the Site.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. The user gives permission to the Site Administration to collect,
        process and store his personal personal data, as well as to send text
        and graphic information of an advertising nature.
      </p>
      <p>
        3. The Parties undertake to comply with this agreement governing the
        legal relationship associated with the establishment, change and
        termination of the confidentiality regime with respect to the personal
        information of the Parties and not to disclose confidential information
        to third parties.
      </p>
      <p>
        4. The Site Administration collects two types of information about the
        User:
      </p>
      <p>
        - personal information that the User deliberately disclosed to the Site
        Administration in order to use the resources of the Site;
      </p>
      <p>
        - technical information automatically collected by the software of the
        Site during its visit. When the User visits the Site, the support
        service automatically becomes available information from the standard
        server logs. This includes the IP address of the User's computer (or
        proxy server, if it is used to access the Internet), the name of the
        Internet provider, domain name, type of browser and operating system,
        information about the site from which the User made the transition to
        the Site, the pages of the Site which the User visits, the date and time
        of these visits, the files that the User uploads. This information is
        analyzed programmatically in an aggregated (impersonal) form to analyze
        website traffic, and is used in the development of proposals for its
        improvement and development. The relationship between the IP address and
        the User's personal information is never disclosed to third parties,
        except when required by the legislation of the country of which the User
        is a resident.
      </p>
      <p>
        5. The Site Administration takes the protection of the User's personal
        data very seriously and never provides the User's personal information
        to anyone, except when directly requested by the authorized state body.
        All personal information of the User is used to communicate with him, to
        execute a transaction concluded between the Users of the Site using the
        resources of the Site, to analyze site traffic, to develop proposals for
        its improvement and development, and can be disclosed to other third
        parties only with his permission.
      </p>
      <p>
        6. The Site Administration protects the User's personal information,
        applying generally accepted security methods to ensure the protection of
        information from loss, distortion and unauthorized distribution.
        Security is implemented by firewall software, access verification
        procedures, the use of cryptographic information protection tools, and
        compliance with the privacy policy.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Site implements a user identification technology based on the use of
        cookies. Cookies are small files that are stored on the User's computer
        by means of a web browser. Cookies may be stored on the computer used by
        the User to access the Site, which will later be used for automatic
        authorization, as well as for collecting statistical data, in particular
        on Site traffic. The Site Administration does not store personal data or
        passwords in cookies. The user has the right to prevent the storage of
        cookies on the computer used to access the Site by adjusting his browser
        accordingly. It should be borne in mind that all services using this
        technology may be unavailable.
      </p>
      <p>
        7. The Site Administration has the right to make changes to this Privacy
        Policy without the consent of the User. The new Privacy Policy comes
        into force from the moment it is posted on the Site, unless otherwise
        provided by the new edition of the Privacy Policy.
